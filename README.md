# Tech-Mechs
A Lemmings-like game which encourages user creativity.

NOTE: I cannot accept pull requests due to this being an individual college project. Starting in May 2018, I should be able to accept pull requests.

HOW TO RUN:

To run this game, you will need Python version 3.6.4 and the Pygame library installed with it. If you already have Python, you may skip Step 1. If you already have Pygame with Python, you may skip step 2 as well.

Step 1: You need to install Python 3.6.4 on your computer. You can download it from https://www.python.org/ Once you have downloaded it, run the install process.

Step 2: Once you have Python installed, you will need the external Pygame library to be installed in Python. The easiest way to do this is with the pip tool, which comes installed with Python version 3.6.4! All you have to do is run the command prompt or Terminal and type the following command:

pip install pygame

This command should download and install Pygame for you.

Step 3: Now from this game's GitHub page, click the green button that says "Clone or download, and select "Download ZIP". This will download all of the game's necessary files into a .ZIP file. Then simply unzip the files into a directory.

Step 4: Once the files are in a directory, run main.py either from the Command Prompt/Terminal or by opening the file in a Python IDE (IDLE is one such IDE with comes with Python 3.5.4) and running it.

# Running Multiplayer games
Right now, you can only run multiplayer as a test on two different windows on one computer. To simulate multiplayer, run the file startServer.py on the command line, and then run main.py on two different command line windows. You will now have two different windows running Tech Mechs with the server running in the background. Click on multiplayer on both main windows and then select a level. You should then have a multiplayer level running with each window having access to a different team of Tech Mechs.
